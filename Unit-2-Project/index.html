 <h1>The World of Dragon Ball</h1>
  <p>Dragon Ball consists of many different powerful characters,each with their own original stories and techniques. As the main protagonist, Goku always loves a good battle, whether it's to save the universe or to test out his abilities and grow stronger. Many villains have tried to beat Goku, and some even became valuable allies, but Goku always finds a way to win, whether his rival-turned-ally Vegeta lends him a hand, his son Gohan fights by his side, or any of the other Z fighters lend a hand.</p>
  <p>In the following pages, I'll be giving the fun facts about a few key characters: the main protagonist Goku, his son Gohan, and Vegeta.I'll list their strengths, weaknesses, and abilities/techniques that they've shown off throughout the series. I hope you enjoy, and happy reading!</p>
