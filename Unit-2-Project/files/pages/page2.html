  <h1>Gohan</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Named after Goku's grandpa, Gohan is the half human, half saiyan hybrid son of Goku and his wife, Chi-Chi. Since he was young, Gohan has shown signs of extraordinary hidden power. Through training with Goku as a young teen, Gohan learned to tap into this power at will and on occasion has even surpassed Goku himself. </p>
  <h2>Abilities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Super Saiyan- like Goku, Gohan is able to tap into the power of a super saiyan.</li>
    <li>Super Saiyan 2- Gohan was the first to achieve this form. Being forced to watch as his friends get pummeled by Cell's offspring, and ultimately watching Cell kill Android #16, Gohan's rage boils over and he unleashes his true power to kill Cell.</li>
    <li>Potential Unleashed (Ultimate Gohan)-after training with the Z Sword under the watch of the Supreme Kai, Gohan accidentally snaps the sword in half while Goku is helping him test it out. Releasing the Elder Kai, he unlocks Gohan's hidden potential to help defeat Majin Buu. Still in base form, he powers up to his complete maximum while taking on some facial features and spiky hair of Super Saiyan 2.</li>
    <li>Beast Form (Ultimate Form Perfected)- Gohan's Potential Unleashed mastered. With a white aura and red lightning, red eyes and silver,spiky hair, Gohan has unleashed his inner beast.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Techniques</h2>

    <li>Kamehameha-Learned from Goku</li>
    <li>Masenko- Learned from Piccolo</li>
    <li>Special Beam Cannon- Learned from Piccolo</li>
    <li>Burst Rush- Unleashes his power to deliver a deadly combo followed by a Kamehameha</li>
  </ol>
