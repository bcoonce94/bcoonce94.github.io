  <h1>Goku</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Goku is a Saiyan who was born on Planet Vegeta as Kakarot just days before the evil overlord Frieza blew it up. To save him, Bardock, Goku's father and Gine, Goku's mother, sent him to Earth so he could survive. Goku was found by an old and kind man, Gohan, who raised little Kakarot and renamed him Goku. Goku was really tough on his grandpa Gohan, until one day he fell into a ravine and severely injured his head. After he recovered, Goku became a loving and caring young boy and trained under the likes of Master Roshi, Korin, Kami, and many others.</p>
